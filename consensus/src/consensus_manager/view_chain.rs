//! The [`ViewChain`] is a data structure that represents the chain of views in the consensus protocol,
//! that have not yet been finalized by a supra-majority vote (n-f) or a nullification.
//!
//! The [`ViewChain`] is a modular component that is responsible solely for the following tasks:
//!
//! - Routing messages to the appropriate view context and communicating the decision event produced by the [`ViewContext`] to the higher-level components,
//!   such as the [`ViewProgressManager`].
//! - Finalize and persist the oldest non-finalized views. That said, the [`ViewChain`] does not perform
//!   the decision logic for finalization, this is left to the higher-level components, such as the [`ViewProgressManager`].
//! - Ensure the SM Sync Invariance and the Non-finalization M-Notarization Progression Invariance are respected (see below).
//!
//! The current logic relies fundamentally on the following State Machine Replication invariant:
//!   
//! INVARIANT (SM Sync Invariance):
//!
//! If view `v` is finalized by either a nullification or a l-notarization, then all smaller views `w < v` must also
//! be finalized. Otherwise, these means that AT LEAST (f + 1) replicas have NOT nullified or voted for view `w < v`, but they
//! have done so for view `v`, this means that at least one honest replica has not followed the protocol, and is therefore
//! faulty. This is in direct contraction with the fact that at least `n - f` replicas out of `n >= 5 f + 1` are honest.
//!
//! A direct consequence of this invariant reasoning is that the [`ViewChain`] must always have consecutive non-finalized views,
//! i.e. the non-finalized views must form a contiguous range of view numbers.
//!
//! INVARIANT (Non-finalization M-Notarization Progression Invariance):
//!
//! In order for a view to progress but not be considered finalized, it must have only received a m-notarization,
//! as both nullifications and l-notarizations are considered finalizations.
//!
//! Moreover, it is important to notice that a view `v` cannot receive both a l-notarization and a nullification (see the
//! original paper for the proof).
//!
//! Therefore, the [`ViewChain`] is composed of a chain of consecutive non-finalized views
//!
//! v1 -> ... -> vk -> v(k+1) -> ... -> vn
//!
//! Where `vn` is the current (non-finalized) view (which is always present), and `v1` is the oldest non-finalized view.
//! Moreover, it follows that all views `v1, ..., vn-1` must have received a m-notarization (as there was a view progression event).
//!
//! `vn` is the only view that has not yet received a m-notarization (neither a nullification nor a l-notarization).
